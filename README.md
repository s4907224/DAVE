This Maya tool **D**oes **A**utomatic **V**aried **E**nvironments.

The end goal of this tool is to save artist time by attempting to decorate interiors to an acceptable level of plausibility and quality, on a scale of tens (if not hundreds) of buildings each with again, tens of rooms.  The tool will eventually be supplied with a library of props, with it eventually creating an output file that could be read by interpreters written for DAVE into any other application (i.e. Unreal, Houdini etc).  The tool is written for Maya  as a host application.
