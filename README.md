This Maya tool **D**oes **A**utomatic **V**aried **E**nvironments.

To run, paste the contents of src/dave.py into Maya's script editor and run.

When prompted, select the root directory of DAVE (the directory THIS file is contained in).

Example scenes are provided in the example_scenes folder.
sceneUsedInDemo is exactly that.
tagged is the above file but with all tagging in place, simply run DAVE, click scan scene and then decorate scene.
rawDecor is the above file with the decorate scene button already pressed, with no user modification of the results.
